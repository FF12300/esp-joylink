#   GEN_LIBS - list of libs to be generated ()
#   GEN_IMAGES - list of images to be generated ()

# Configuration i.e. compile options etc.

# Generally values applying to a tree are captured in the
#   makefile at its root level - these are then overridden

# Each subtree potentially has an include directory
#   corresponding to the common APIs applicable to modules
#   rooted at that subtree. Accordingly, the INCLUDE PATH
#   of a module can only contain the include directories up 
#   its parent path, and not its siblings
#
# Required for each makefile to inherit from the parent
